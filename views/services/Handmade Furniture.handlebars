                    <pWhen designing corporate office interiors, the key is to strike a balance between styling and optimum space utilisation.
                        Right from the entry through the reception to the work floor and conference rooms to office furniture
                        design and lighting, every aspect of the corporate office should reflect the vision of the company. That’s
                        exactly why we have the best commercial interior designers in Mumbai in our team.</p>
                        <p>Right from first day our client is aware about what is wrong and right. Which is compundable and
                            what is not compoundable?</p>
                        <p>At Nitido Design, the expert designers base your corporate office design on a thorough analysis of
                            what you want and what your clients, employees and business associates are looking to experience
                            when they enter your office. Our number one priority while undertaking a commercial interior
                            design project is to understand what the company truly stands for and represent the same in the
                            best conceivable way. </p>
                        <p>
                            We believe that the best office interior design is the one that not just catches the clients’ attention but also creates
                            an efficient workplace for the employees and enhances their morale. In keeping with this, our
                            office interior designers in Mumbai have closely worked with a number of multi-faceted companies
                            in the city and elsewhere over the years and curated some of the most remarkable corporate spaces.
                        </p>
                        <p>When a real estate firm in BKC desired a commercial office space design exuding elegance and vibrancy,
                            our top interior designers took up the challenge and went all in to give the client what he wanted.
                            While we knew that incorporating natural light inside an office in Mumbai is not an easy task,
                            we accomplished the same with the use of soft neutral tones of black, white, brown, blue and
                            grey across the space.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, Zandra in Mulund wanted their corporate office interior design to have a traditional look,
                            yet a modern feel. We took inspiration from their tagline ‘Zeal for life’ and made use of common
                            industrial materials like steel, glass and concrete to create a unique interior design that reflected
                            their democratic organizational structure as well as encouraged innovative, new-age thinking
                            among its occupants.</p>
                        <p>
                            We understand that an office layout design needs to be in sync with the purpose and overall vibe of the space. For instance,
                            while working on a creative office in Khar, we had some of our best commercial interior designers
                            create an inspired office space that is tasteful and pragmatic yet distinctly original. A compact
                            and elegant café and even a sleep pod were added to the office for late nights at work.</p>
                        <p>At our own office centrally located in Worli, we have proportioned well-lit spaces and added a natural
                            indoor garden to give the space a light and fresh feel. There is also a relaxing café to provide
                            a sense of wellness and inspiration. We take the same approach while designing any other office
                            and place more emphasis on collective comfort and vitality over just some attractive commercial
                            interior fit-outs.</p>
                        <p>Designing a retail store requires a very different approach than corporate office interiors. While
                            working on an Indian garment showroom in Mumbai, our creative experts made sure that the colours,
                            lights and textures used in interior design made the showroom look inviting, without stealing
                            the attention from its offerings. With minimal furniture and huge storage units, the place now
                            has everything it needs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was also a new experience for us to work on a multi-region project like Papacream Ice-cream Parlours. Our best interior
                            designers put in their minds together to give the place an unmistakable visual identity and design
                            it to be bright, fun and interactive with the use of unique design elements and pastel shades.
                            Its outlets, designed by Nitido, are now present in Mumbai, Pune, Jaipur, Bangalore, Surat and
                            Vizag.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over the years, we have undertaken various projects – from sales offices to corporate spaces and what not in Mumbai including
                            areas like Fort, Nariman Point and Deonar, and also in Thane and Pune. Every project we have
                            worked on had a unique challenge, but our experts in modern office design always approached them
                            with zeal, dedication and efficiency to deliver timely results par excellence.</p>
                        <p>
                            Our experience of working on different projects and taking up unique assignments day after day has made us one of the best
                            commercial renovation and interior design companies in Mumbai today. So whether you are an enterprise,
                            a law firm or a digital marketing agency, we promise to create the best commercial interior design
                            for your office based on your needs as well as that of your business</p>
