        <div class="col-lg">
          <p>Born and raised in Haryana, I moved to delhi in the mid-eighties to pursue a career in interior designs & marketing.
            Always a lover of interior design, I enrolled in design courses at delhi while working as a design assistant
            at a firm. Two years later I started my company.
            <br> Over the past 35 years my clientele and I have grown together. I am now not only a businessman, but also a husband
            and father who understands the fast pace of life – especially living in delhi(NCR) City. This firsthand experience
            in trying to balance it all (as stylishly as possible) has helped me and my team become experts in creating exceptional
            interiors for real people living busy lives in delhi(NCR) and beyond. We are committed to the decoration and
            design of beautiful, stylish homes which are also comfortable, practical and thoughtful. We excel in creating
            spaces that welcome both the joys and trials of living a full life.
            <br> Here at eagledecor we take a friendly but highly organized approach to each client’s project. Great communication
            and systematic project management keep our clients in the know each step of the way, without making them feel
            overwhelmed. Our client roster is comprised predominately of return business and client referrals, which is a
            strong testament to both our creative talent and work ethic. Most clients return for their next projects: new
            residences, vacation homes or just design refreshes. Our ultimate goal is to provide exceptional service to each
            client and deliver them their dream home. We truly love what we do and want all our clients to feel nothing less
            than thrilled with their experience.
